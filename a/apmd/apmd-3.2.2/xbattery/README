This little application and widget show the battery status of your laptop.
It'll start flashing, when you're low on power. To build it, do the following,
   xmkmf
   make
   make install
   make install.man

Then all you need to do is configure your window manager to start it.
I have the following in my .fvwm2rc file,
	*FvwmButtons(1x1, Swallow(UseOld) "XBattery" \
	'Exec xbattery -bg grey -xrm "xbattery*popup*background:white" &')
which adds it to the button box.

As the widget and application are separate, you can put the widget directly
into another application, if you want to. All the files are available under
the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.
See the file COPYING-2.0 for the terms and conditions. If you do use this in
an application or library, drop me an email, so I am aware of it.
