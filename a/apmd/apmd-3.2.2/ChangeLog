2003-01-16  Chris Hanson  <cph@zurich.ai.mit.edu>

	* Release 3.2.0: further cleanups by Thomas Hood after several
	  versions of the 3.1.0 Debian packages.

2002-12-08  Thomas Hood  <jdthood@yahoo.co.uk>

	* Release 3.1.0
	  Some of the changes:
	* Clean up handling of suspend and standby rejection.
	  (It was proposed long ago that the Linux apm driver allow
	  userspace to reject suspend & standby requests by issuing an
	  ioctl(APM_IOC_REJECT).  This has not yet been implemented.
	  Nevertheless, most of the supporting code has now been added
	  to apmlib and apmd.)
	  apm_reject() is defined as -EINVAL in apm.h; however a stub
	  function of the same name is still compiled for inclusion in
	  libapm
	* Try to use the term "line" rather than "AC", since the external
	  power source isn't always AC.
	* apm.h
		* Define apm_reject() as a constant (-EINVAL) so that
		  programs that use this header will have the call
		  optimized away for now
	* apmlib.c
		* Clean up
		* apm_suspend() passes EBUSY error code from apm driver
		* apm_reject() returns -EINVAL for now, but the code
		  should now be ready for implementation (in the apm
		  driver) of userspace rejection of suspend and standby
		  requests.
		* Remove unneeded apm_last_error() function.  Errors
		  are returned by ioctl() in errno and can be returned
		  from functions in apmlib such as apm_suspend() and
		  apm_reject().
	* apmd.c
		* Clean up extensively
		* Improve battery status printing
		* Improve verbosity handling
		* Add -T option to terminate proxies that fail to 
		  complete within a reasonable time
		* Add -i option to deal with bogus LOW BATTERY events
		  on some machines
		* Handle -EBUSY error code (which signals rejection
		  of suspend request) from apm_suspend()
		* Fix up use of apm_reject().  apmd.c should now be
		  ready for implementation of userspace rejection of
		  suspend and standby requests.
		* Log event before running proxy
		* Call proxy with "change power" when battery starts
		  or stops charging
		* Move change log material at the top of the file
		  to this ChangeLog
	* apmd.8
		* Largely rewritten
	* apm.c
		* Fix bug: didn't update on switch to battery power
		* Clean up output
	* xapm.c
		* 'P' => 'L' in display   (for "line" power)
	* Makefile
		* Add some targets
	* on_ac_power
		* Largely rewritten

	instead of a minor one; reset on_ac_power upon resuming from a suspend.

	* debian/00hwclock, debian/control, apmd.8:

	Some debian patches from long ago...

1999-10-18  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* apm.c:

	Fix to the 'apm' command: -m should _always_ display the minutes remaining,
	not sometimes the seconds.  Thanks to Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>
	for pointing this out.

1999-08-09  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/00hwclock, debian/changelog, debian/rules, apmd.c, apmlib.c:

1999-08-03  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/changelog, debian/rules, Makefile: *** empty log message ***

1999-08-02  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* xbattery/.cvsignore, xbattery/Imakefile:

	xbattery .cvsignore file and Makefile fix.

	* xbattery/BatteryGauge.c, xbattery/BatteryGauge.h, xbattery/BatteryGaugeP.h, xbattery/Imakefile, xbattery/README, xbattery/xbattery.c, xbattery/xbattery.man, .cvsignore, BUGS.apmsleep, Makefile, apmsleep.1, apmsleep.c:

	Integrated apmsleep, and added xbattery (but without Makefile support).

	* debian/00hwclock:

	New Debian systems set UTC instead of GMT in /etc/default/rcS (yay for
	gratuitous changes).  We'll use them both in the debian 00hwclock script.

1999-07-28  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/00hwclock:

	Fix for 00hwclock to make it work in bare-bones POSIX shells.  From Obi
	<graziano@ucsd.edu>

1999-07-05  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* apmlib.c: Got rid of a compile warning.

	* apm.h, apmd.c, apmd_proxy, apmlib.c:

	Patch from Craig Markwardt:

	apmd_proxy: Added more PCMCIA handling, debugging examples, ability to
	disable sound, X-Windows, etc.  Some configuration options are now up front.
	Most power profiling is disabled by default, to not abuse incompatible APM
	BIOSes.

	Makefile: Install apmd_proxy with -Vt option, numbers the backup files.

	apm.h, apmlib.c: added functions apm_reject, apm_last_error, apm_error_name.
	Set APM_REJECT_ENABLED automatically based on kernel IOCTL value.

	apmd.c (apmd_log): correct semantics for syslog().

	apmd.c (apmd_power_reset, apmd_check_power): correct semantics for apmd_log
	(no multiply-protected "%" signs).

	apmd.c (apmd_check_power): moved synthetic_low_battery; made simple logging
	event a minor_checkpoint again, as per definition.

	* Makefile, apmd.c, apmd_proxy:

	Changed version to beta9 so I (hopefully) don't get confused.

1999-06-16  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* Makefile, apmd.c:

	Fixes for a VERY stupid Makefile bug, and some sprintf-percent-symbol fixes
	from Craig Markwardt <craigm@pcasun3.gsfc.nasa.gov>.

	* debian/changelog: *** empty log message ***

	* Makefile, apmd.8, apmd.c, apmd_proxy, apmlib.c:

	Lots of updates and bugfixes from David Brownell <db@post.harvard.edu>.  He
	also wins the grand prize for getting the man page up to date, although
	there is no prize:

	* Reduced spurious and repeated syslog messages, as well as the number of
	  times the proxy gets called during charging/discharging.  Minor cleanup and
	  commenting.  Documentation updated.  Power status reporting now goes by 
	  line status only.  -- David Brownell, db@post.harvard.edu, 14 June 1999
	  
1999-06-09  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/apmd_proxy:

	Fix for a REALLY dumb bug in debian/apmd_proxy (oops) from
	<davec@asylum.apocalypse.org>.

1999-06-07  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* Makefile, apmd.c:

	Default location for apmd to look for apmd_proxy is now the same as the
	directory where it is installed.  (Neat, huh?)

	* debian/rules:

	Debian package now actually installs the man pages again!

1999-06-05  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* LSM:

	Hmm, LSM entry was rather out-of-date.

	* debian/00hwclock, debian/apmd.init, debian/apmd_proxy, debian/changelog, debian/conffiles, debian/control, debian/dirs, debian/rules:

	Make a Debian-specific apmd_proxy program (maybe I should just make that
	everyone's default?) and included a Debian-specific 00hwclock script that
	will be run to set the clock at the right times.

	Updated all the other Debian stuff so that it works.

	* Makefile, apmd.c, apmd_proxy, apmlib.c, on_ac_power:

	Removed some pauses, and wrote my own on_ac_power script.

	* apm.c, apm.h, apmd.c, apmd_proxy, apmlib.c, tailf.c, xapm.c:

	Ran the whole thing through 'indent' to widen the tabs.

	* Makefile, apm.c, apmd.c, apmlib.c, tailf.c, xapm.c:

	Merged back the post-3.06beta6 changes (well, the ones that Craig didn't
	obsolete.)

	* Makefile, apmd.c, apmd_proxy, apmlib.c:

	Added massive changes to clean up the code and implement a "central
	dispatcher" -- many thanks to Craig Markwardt
	<craigm@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>:

	* Changes to support centralized dispatch routines, generalized logging,
	  general code cleanup, add support for apm_reject and APM_CAPABILITY_CHANGE.

	In doing this, I lost all the other changes people sent in since beta6...
	now I need to re-integrate them, where applicable.

1999-05-09  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* apmd.c:

	Patch from Seth Golub <seth@thehouse.org> to fix the broken implementation
	of on-battery and on-ac-power events.  Oops.

1999-04-07  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/rules: *** empty log message ***

	* Makefile, apm.1, apm.c, apm.h, apmlib.c, kernel-2.0.36.patch:

	Added a patch to support "ignore suspend events" from Jon A. Christopher
	<jon@quorum.tamu.edu>.  (Requires you to apply a patch to your kernel; a
	patch for kernel 2.0.36 is included.)

	Changed Makefile to grab include files from various kernel source
	directories before resorting to /usr/include/linux.

1999-04-05  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/changelog: *** empty log message ***

	* debian/changelog:

	Finalizing changes for 3.0beta6.

	* xapm.c:

	Included a patch for the IBM Thinkpad 770X from Bill Mair
	<bill.mair@bm-soft.com>.  The letters P or B in the display represent AC
	power and battery power, respectively.

1999-03-02  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* Makefile, apmd.c:

	Patch to add now-on-battery and now-on-wallpower scripts, from J.D. Smith
	<jdsmith@astrosun.tn.cornell.edu>.  This will probably change to a more
	flexible scheme in the future, but this is an awfully popular feature so
	I'll include it now:

	* Add support to apmd for ac_offline, ac_online commands to
	  execute when the power status changes.
	  This is useful to set hard drive spindown rates and other
	  configureable power saving options when the ac cord is 
	  inserted or removed.  
	  New options:                              long form:
		-a ac_online_cmd                         ac_online
		-b ac_offline_cmd                        ac_offline

	* apmd.c:

	Added -q "quiet mode" patch from Robert de Bath <robert.debath@colt.de>.
	When this option is given, apmd doesn't syslog so many different events.

	* debian/changelog: *** empty log message ***

1999-01-24  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* apmd.c:

	Must use fork() instead of vfork() -- there's actually a difference between
	them in 2.2.0 kernels!

1998-11-08  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/changelog, Makefile:

	Changed version number to 3.0beta4.

	* debian/apmd.init, debian/changelog, apm.1, apmd.8, apmd.c, tailf.1, xapm.1:

	Changes for Debian's apmd 3.0beta3-3.

1998-09-17  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/dirs, debian/changelog, debian/apmd.init, TODO:

	Checked in 3.0beta3-2 changes a bit late.

1998-09-12  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/control, debian/changelog, apmd.c, Makefile:

	apmd 3.0beta3

	* apmlib.c, apmd.c:

	Thinkpad + features patch from Pavel Machek
	<pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>.

1998-09-11  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/.cvsignore, debian/changelog, Makefile, LSM, ANNOUNCE, .cvsignore:

	Released apmd 3.0beta2.

	* apmd.c:

	post_resume_cmd doesn't run, and we don't reset the clock when coming back
	from "standby" mode.  Also fixed some error message output.

1998-09-06  Avery Pennarun  <apenwarr@insight>

	* debian/rules, debian/dirs, debian/changelog, debian/apmd.init, apmd.c, Makefile, .cvsignore:

	Fixed implementation of '-s' option (now I know why this was called "PRE"
	3.0 when I got it).  Fixed up Debian package scripts a bit more.

	Releasing this version as 3.0beta1.

	* debian/dirs, debian/changelog, debian/apmd.init:

	Changes to support /etc/apm-suspend.d and /etc/apm-resume.d under Debian.

	* apmd.c, apmd.8, Makefile:

	Added --utc (-u) option, to specify that the BIOS clock is set to UTC.  We
	also choose automatically between the /sbin/clock and /sbin/hwclock
	programs.

	* debian/apmd.init, debian/changelog, debian/conffiles, debian/control,
	  debian/copyright, debian/dirs, debian/postinst, debian/postrm,
	  debian/preinst, debian/prerm, debian/rules, apm.c:

	Integrated Debian patch from apmd-2.4-12 package, and updated a few
	Debian-related things.

	* apmd-2.4.Notes, README.transfer, apmd-2.4-to-pre-3.0-diffs, COPYING,
	  COPYING.LIB, LSM, .cvsignore, ANNOUNCE:

	Rearranged a few files to take over ownership of the package and prepare for
	release of 3.0beta1.

	Subject: New maintainer for Linux apmd package
	
	-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
	
	
	Avery Pennarun, currently the Debian apmd maintainer, has graciously agreed
	to take over general maintenance of the Linux apmd package.  Since the
	release of apmd-2.4, I have been extremely busy and have not been able to
	work on apmd as much as I would have liked.  Further, I do not expect to be
	able to pick up maintenance of apmd in the foreseeable future, so it is
	best for the Linux community that I officially transfer control of the
	package to Avery.

	* ANNOUNCE: Update required kernel version number
	Public release of apmd 2.4

1996-04-21  faith  <faith@insight>

	NOTE:
	
	Sun Apr 21 16:25:43 1996
	
	This is a completely re-written apmd for Linux.  It will work with 1.3.58
	kernels, which have a new format for /proc/apm, and with older kernels.  I
	have severely limited time to work on APM -- please do *NOT* send me mail
	about how to use these utilities with older kernels.  If you want to use
	these utilities with a production kernel, please wait until 2.0.x comes out
	-- since we are in a code freeze, it is only a waste of time to
	use these utilities or the APM patches with 1.2.x.
	
	If you have bug reports, please include patches which fix them -- chances
	are that I will not be able to produce your specific bug on my system.
	
	apm is a stand-alone utility which prints the /proc/apm information in a
	nice format.
	
	xapmd is a little X utility that provides a bar graph of the battery
	status.
